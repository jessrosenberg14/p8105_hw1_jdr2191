## Problem 1

First, I will load the tidyverse.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.1 ──

    ## ✓ ggplot2 3.3.5     ✓ purrr   0.3.4
    ## ✓ tibble  3.1.4     ✓ dplyr   1.0.7
    ## ✓ tidyr   1.1.3     ✓ stringr 1.4.0
    ## ✓ readr   2.0.1     ✓ forcats 0.5.1

    ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

Next, I will create a dataframe that includes a random sample of size 10
from a standard Normal distribution, a logical vector indicating whether
elements of the sample are greater than 0, a character vector of length
10, and a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”.
I will also ensure that this was done correctly by looking at the
dataframe after I create the required variables.

``` r
problem1_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  norm_samp_greater0 = norm_samp > 0,
  letter_char = c("A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J"),
  color_factor = factor(c("purple","purple","purple","purple","blue","blue","blue",
                        "red","red","red")),
)
 problem1_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    norm_samp norm_samp_greater0 letter_char color_factor
    ##        <dbl> <lgl>              <chr>       <fct>       
    ##  1    0.876  TRUE               A           purple      
    ##  2    1.05   TRUE               B           purple      
    ##  3    0.234  TRUE               C           purple      
    ##  4    1.52   TRUE               D           purple      
    ##  5   -1.21   FALSE              E           blue        
    ##  6    0.556  TRUE               F           blue        
    ##  7   -0.976  FALSE              G           blue        
    ##  8    0.0671 TRUE               H           red         
    ##  9    1.22   TRUE               I           red         
    ## 10    0.509  TRUE               J           red

Next, I will attempt to take the mean of each of these variables I just
created.

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.3854967

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, norm_samp_greater0))
```

    ## [1] 0.8

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, letter_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem1_df, letter_char)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, color_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem1_df, color_factor)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

We can take the mean of both our numeric variable (norm\_samp) and our
logical variable (norm\_samp\_greater0).

We cannot take the mean of our character variable (letter\_char) or our
factor variable (color\_factor). When we attempt to do these, we get the
following error: “the argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA.”

To further investigate what is happening here, I will convert the
logical, character, and factor variables to numeric variables.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, norm_samp_greater0))
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, letter_char))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, color_factor))
```

The logical variable is converted to all 1s and 0s. This happens because
our logical variable is binary (false becomes 0 and true becomes 1).
When we took the mean of the logical variable, we got a result, which
makes sense as we are taking the mean of 0s and 1s, which is possible.
The character variable results in all NAs with a warning message. This
happens because character variables cannot easily be converted to
numeric variables as the categories do not have numeric equivalents.
When we tried to take the mean of then character vector we got an error,
which makes sense because it is not possible to take the mean of
character/text values. The factor variable is converted into 1s, 2s and
3s, where each level corresponds to a number. We were previously unable
to take the mean of the vector variable as each level was text, but we
are able to convert a factor variable to a numeric variable and
subsequently take its mean.

## Problem 2

First, I will load the penguins dataset.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

penguins
```

    ##  7 Adelie  Torgersen           38.9          17.8               181        3625
    ##  8 Adelie  Torgersen           39.2          19.6               195        4675

    ## # … with 334 more rows, and 2 more variables: sex <fct>, year <int>

Next, we will describe the penguins dataset.

The dataset includes the following variables: species, island,
bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g,
sex, year. The data was collected from 2007 to 2009. The dataset
includes penguins from the islands of Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen and
includes penguins from the following species: Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo.
In the dataset, values for penguins’ bill length ranges from NA mm to NA
mm.

There are 8 columns and 344 rows in the penguins dataset. The mean
flipper length is 200.9152047 (excluding two values = NA).

Next, I will generate a scatterplot of flipper\_length\_mm vs
bill\_length\_mm with color points using the species variable.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color=species)) + geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

Lastly, I will save this scatterplot to my working directory.

``` r
ggsave("penguin_plot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
