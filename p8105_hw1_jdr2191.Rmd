##Problem 1

First I will load the tidyverse
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
problem1_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("purple","purple","purple","purple","blue","blue","blue",
                        "red","red","red")),
  problem1_df
)
```


Create a data frame comprised of:

a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
a character vector of length 10
a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”
