##Problem 1

First I will load the tidyverse
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Create a data frame comprised of:

a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
a character vector of length 10
a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”
